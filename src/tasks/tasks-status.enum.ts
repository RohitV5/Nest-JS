export enum TaskStatus {
    OPEN = "OPEN",
    IN_PROGRESS = "IN_PROGRESS",
    DONE = "DONE"
}


// WE want status field to have fixed value so we assign it a enum.

// Interfaces a typescript feature which are removed on compilation.it just helps us create a shape on object on compilation.
// Classes are similar but they exist after compilation and we can add functions in it.
