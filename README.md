# Nest_Typescript

# Create a new nest JS PRroject -> Nest New

# Remove app controller and service and app.spec files.

# Run -> npm run start:dev

# Make an new module ->nest g module task


# Controller decorated as @Controller('task') -> will handle endpoint with /task, contains handler decorated with @get, @post etc which handles endpoints. 

# Make a new controller named tasks and the CLI will look for a module folder name tasks and import it in that , if not found they it will add in app module
# nest g controller tasks --no-spec

# Nest saves us from writing boilerplate code.
